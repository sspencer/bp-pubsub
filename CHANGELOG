Version 0.0.4
  * Callbacks are invalidated after bp.complete(), so addSubscriber no longer returns
    unique ID.  Delete removeSubscriber() api.
  * Simple case works.  Tested on OS X.  Can open one or more windows in both Safari
    and Firefox and send messages across all browsers/windows.
  * If a window goes away, messages no longer sent.  Might have to write an
    Observer to rescue failures.

Version 0.0.3
  * Code is mostly there, but callback is not invoked.
